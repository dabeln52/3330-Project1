# 3330-Project1
Welcome to our final project. To get started the person writing this, Karch, used eclipse as my code editor, my other partner Derik noted that he was having importing in the project to visual studio code. 
We think weve fixed the issue but just to be sure if you run this program try to do it in eclipse. How I got the program to start is to hit the little green arrow to run the program(Eclipse), 
after that a main menu pops up where you can choose which option you want to do, enter 1-14, these are the choices anything other than 1-14 will be a handled error. 
other than that thats pretty much all you need to know to run this program.
